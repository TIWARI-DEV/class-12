      <h2>a. Data Dictionary</h2>
      <p>A data dictionary is a centralized repository of metadata that describes the structure and organization of data within a database. It contains information about data elements, relationships, and data usage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="term-block">
      <h2>b. Primary Key</h2>
      <p>A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a database table. It ensures that each entry is distinct and can be used to retrieve or reference specific records efficiently.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="term-block">
      <h2>c. Relationship</h2>
      <p>A relationship in a database defines how two or more tables interact with each other. It specifies how data in one table is related to data in another, typically through foreign keys.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="term-block">
      <h2>d. Data Manipulation Language (DML)</h2>
      <p>Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a subset of SQL used for managing data within database objects. It includes operations such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="term-block">
      <h2>e. Structured Query Language (SQL)</h2>
      <p>Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard programming language for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is used to perform tasks such as querying data, updating records, and managing database structures.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="term-block">
      <h2>f. Data Integrity</h2>
      <p>Data integrity refers to the accuracy and consistency of data over its lifecycle. It ensures that data is reliable and remains unchanged during storage and processing unless authorized changes occur.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="term-block">
      <h2>g. Data Definition Language (DDL)</h2>
      <p>Data Definition Language (DDL) is a subset of SQL used to define and manage database structures. It includes commands such as CREATE, ALTER, and DROP, which are used to create and modify database schemas.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="term-block">
      <h2>h. Data Security</h2>
      <p>Data security involves protecting data from unauthorized access and corruption throughout its lifecycle. This includes measures such as encryption, access controls, and secure backups.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="term-block">
      <h2>i. Database System</h2>
      <p>A database system is a software application that interacts with end-users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. It provides a systematic way to manage, retrieve, and store data.</p>
